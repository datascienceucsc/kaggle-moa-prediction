# Meeting notes

## Thursday 12-11-2020

- classes are unbalanced, try fitting in "balanced" way
- dimensionallity reduction would be useful given that there are 100s of features
    1. try PCA (Anders)
    2. try autoencoder (Adriel)
    3. In both cases, look at mutual information of "new" features to see if they are useful
    4. Maybe keep both original features and features generated by PCA
- vanilla DNN overfits according to existing notebooks
